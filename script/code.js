//1.Make a variable with a data of a string and check the type of this variable.
let words="jeff"
console.log(typeof (words))


//2.Reassign the value to a number and check the type again. Did it change?

let jeff= 56
console.log(typeof (jeff))


//3.Go ahead and create a variable with every data type you know of. Double check that you covered all of them by using the typeof check.

//undefined
let x;
console.log(typeof (x))

//object
let zero=null;
console.log(typeof (zero))

//booleans
let answer=true;
console.log(typeof (answer))

//undefined
let leg;
console.log(typeof (leg))
